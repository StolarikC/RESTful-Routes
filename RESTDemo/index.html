    <h1>What is Rest?</h1>
    <h2><i>Representational State Transfer</i></h2>
    <p>REST is an "architectural style for distributed hypermedia systems." Yikes.</p>
    <p>It's basically a set of guidelines for how a client & server should communicate and perform CRUD operations on a
        given resource.</p>
    <p>The main idea of REST is treating data on the server-side as resources that can be CRUDed. (Create, Read, Update,
        Delete/Destroy)</p>
    <p>The most common way of approaching REST is in formatting the URLs and HTTP verbs in your applications.</p>
